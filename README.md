By the end of this module, students will have constructed a solid driving base that serves as the foundation for their driving baseic projects. This module not only teaches essential building skills but also highlights the importance of a well-designed base for achieving optimal driving base performance.

### BEG-01 - Perimeter Square

In this module, students will program the driving base to move in the shape of a square along the perimeter of a 34" x 34" (86.36 cm x 86.36 cm) table using blue Motor blocks. This activity emphasizes basic movement commands and spatial navigation, providing a strong foundation for understanding driving base motion and control.

**Objectives:**

1. **Learn Basic Movement Commands:**
   - **Motor Control:** Students will understand how to use Motor blocks to control the driving base’s movements. They will learn to make the driving base move forward, execute precise turns, and stop at specific points, building foundational skills in driving base programming.

2. **Program a Square Path:**
   - **Path Programming:** Students will program the driving base to move along the perimeter of a square. This involves moving the driving base forward for a set distance, making a 90-degree turn, and repeating this sequence four times to complete the square. This exercise reinforces the concept of structured movement.

3. **Use Loops for Repetition:**
   - **Loop Implementation:** Students will utilize loops to simplify the programming process. By placing the forward movement and turning commands inside a loop, they ensure the driving base performs these actions four times, making the programming more efficient and reducing redundancy.

4. **Focus on Precision and Accuracy:**
   - **Precision Programming:** Students will learn the importance of precision in programming. They will need to carefully adjust the distance and turning angles to ensure the driving base follows the exact path along the table’s perimeter without deviating from the intended square shape.

By the end of this module, students will have a solid understanding of basic movement commands and the use of loops for repetitive actions. This module will also enhance their spatial awareness and ability to control the driving base's navigation accurately.

### BEG-02 
#### Black & White (B&W) Stop-n-Go

In this module, students will learn how to program a driving base to stop and go based on detecting black and white surfaces. This activity introduces the fundamental concept of line detection and involves repetitive movement using simple "wait until" blocks.

**Objectives:**

1. **Program the driving base’s Movement:**
   - **Basic Movement Programming:** Students will create a program that makes the driving base move forward and then stop when it detects a black surface. The driving base will start moving again upon detecting a white surface. This exercise teaches basic programming logic and how to integrate sensors with movement commands.

2. **Develop Two Distinct Programs:**
   - **Program 1:** Students will use specific blocks to detect black and white colors from a color list. This version helps them understand how to work with predefined color categories and basic color detection.
   - **Program 2:** Students will create a program that uses an integer value representing the percentage of light reflected by the surfaces. This version introduces more granular control, where students need to set thresholds to differentiate between "black" and "white" based on light reflection data.

3. **Understand Line Detection:**
   - **Line Detection Basics:** The module focuses on line detection, a crucial skill for many robotics competitions and practical applications. By programming the driving base to follow lines, students gain valuable experience for more complex tasks in future modules.

4. **Implement Repetitive Movement:**
   - **Using "Wait Until" Blocks:** Students will use "wait until" blocks to continuously check for changes in surface color and adjust the driving base’s movement accordingly. This reinforces the use of control blocks for decision-making and iterative actions.

5. **Test and Refine:**
   - **Performance Testing:** Students will test their programs on a track designed with alternating black and white sections to ensure the driving base responds correctly to surface changes. They will refine their programs based on performance, making adjustments to color detection and movement commands as needed.

By the end of this module, students will have a solid understanding of basic line-following techniques and sensor-based control. This foundation will be essential for tackling more advanced robotics programming tasks in future modules.

### BEG-03 
#### Red Green Blue (RGB) Speed Variation

In this module, students will learn how to program a driving base to adjust its speed based on the colors it detects using color sensors. This activity provides an introduction to sensor-based control systems and the use of basic variables for making dynamic adjustments to the driving base's behavior.

**Objectives:**

1. **Assign Integer Values to Variables:**
   - **Color Detection and Speed Variables:** Students will create variables for each color detected by the driving base’s color sensor and assign specific integer values to these variables. For example:
     - **Red Detection:** When the sensor detects the color red, an integer percentage value, such as 15, is assigned to a variable representing the speed.
     - **Green Detection:** When the sensor detects the color green, a different integer value, such as 50, is assigned to a speed variable.
     - **Blue Detection:** When the sensor detects the color blue, another integer value, such as 65, is assigned to a speed variable.
   - **Variable Usage:** These integer values will be used to control the driving base’s speed, allowing students to see how changing the values affects the driving base's performance.

2. **Program Speed Adjustments:**
   - **Implementing Speed Control:** Students will program the driving base to adjust its speed based on the integer values assigned to the variables. The driving base will operate with varying speeds depending on the color detected:
     - **Red Color:** The driving base will move at a slower speed when it detects red.
     - **Green Color:** The driving base will move at a moderate speed when it detects green.
     - **Blue Color:** The driving base will move at its maximum speed when it detects blue.
   - **Testing and Calibration:** Students will test the driving base on a track or surface with different colors to observe how it changes speed. They will refine their programs to ensure accurate and smooth speed transitions.

3. **Understand Sensor-Based Control Systems:**
   - **Sensor Integration:** Students will gain practical experience with integrating color sensors into their programming. They will learn how sensor inputs can be used to control various aspects of the driving base's behavior.
   - **Dynamic Adjustments:** By using variables to represent different speeds, students will understand how to make dynamic adjustments based on real-time sensor data.

By the end of this module, students will have developed a solid understanding of how to use sensors to influence the driving base's speed and behavior. They will also be comfortable working with variables to make real-time adjustments, laying the groundwork for more complex sensor-based programming tasks in future modules.

### BEG-04 
#### Perimeter Forward (FWD)

In this module, students will program their driving base to move forward until it detects an obstacle using ultrasonic (distance) sensors. This activity introduces basic sensor-based navigation and teaches students how to integrate sensor feedback into their driving base's movement, making it suitable for controlled environments.

**Objectives:**

1. **Program Forward Movement:**
   - **Continuous Forward Motion:** Learn to program the driving base to move forward continuously using Motor (blue) blocks. This foundational skill prepares students for integrating sensor feedback into the driving base’s movement.

2. **Use ultrasonic (distance) sensors:**
   - **Obstacle Detection:** Discover how to use ultrasonic (distance) sensors to detect obstacles. Students will program the driving base to stop moving forward when it senses a wall or obstacle in its path.

3. **Implement Turning Mechanism:**
   - **Turning on Detection:** After detecting a wall, the driving base will turn on the spot clockwise to face 90º from its initial direction. This turning maneuver is crucial for navigating around the perimeter of a defined area.

4. **Continue Navigation:**
   - **Movement Sequence:** Program the driving base to continue moving straight after turning until it senses the next wall. This sequence—move forward, sense wall, turn—will be repeated multiple times to navigate around the perimeter.

5. **Final Movement:**
